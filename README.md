# Advanced-EDA

The way to gain a quick perspective on the current situation is through EDA. “Exploratory Data Analysis” is divided into five stages:
1. General Picture
2. Analysis of Categorical Variables
3. Analysis of Numerical Variables
4. Analysis of Target Variables
5. Analysis of Correlation

So, what exactly does “Advanced Functional” mean in the title? It seeks to be able to handle tiny or large-sized data in a scalable, that is, functional fashion and to swiftly gain insights about the data. It does a rapid analysis of the data using general functions.

For writing in which the codes' results are understood:
